## Vue.js Practice Project: Adding Reactivity in HTML
This is a small practice project where I learned how to implement Vue.js directly into an HTML file by importing the Vue library through a CDN. The main goal was to explore how to add reactivity to elements directly within the HTML file without using a complex build process.

### Project Overview
In this project, I created a simple HTML file that uses Vue.js to add reactivity to the content. The project demonstrates the following concepts:
<ul>
  <li>Importing Vue.js directly via a CDN.
  <li>Creating a Vue instance and binding it to an HTML element.
  <li>Using Vue's data-binding and event-handling features.
  <li>Demonstrating reactivity with a simple data model.
</ul>

### Technologies Used
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTML5</strong>: Structure and content.
  <li><strong>Vue.js</strong>: For adding reactivity.
</ul>

### Getting Started
To run the project, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

### What I Learnt
<ul>
  <li>How to include Vue.js in a project without a build process.
  <li>How to create a simple reactive data model directly in an HTML file.
  <li>The basics of Vue.js event handling and data manipulation.
</ul>
